Journal App Client

Check out the API [here](https://github.com/eabrigham/journal-api)

A front end for a digital notebook/bullet journal where a user can write posts on a variety of topics.
Implemented with Javascript and React

A user canâ€¦
* log in/out
* use the website on a computer or a phone
* create a name for the journal
* write a post
* read their own past posts
* title a post

The next version I plan to complete updating and deleting a post.
In the future, I plan to add labels which a user can tag their posts with, and then display only those posts with 
a particular label.
